# CS1656
A collection of projects and labs done in the class Intro to Data Science
## Project 1

Description
This is the first assignment for the CS 1656 -- Introduction to Data Science (CS 2056) class, for the Spring 2023 semester.

Goal
The goal of this assignment was to get familiar with Python and also get exposed to real data.

Task-- pittbikes.py
You are asked to complete a Python program, called pittbikes.py that will access live data from a City Bike Share System and provide answers to specific queries about shared bike availability in the Pittsburgh region.

The program contains a class, Bike, that has three arguments in its constructor, baseURL, station_info and station_status. These arguments are used to define URLs for specific data feeds, namely information about individual stations and the status of every station. You can create an instance of the Bike class by calling its constructor with appropriate URL fragments, and call its methods to run the different parts of the assignment.
